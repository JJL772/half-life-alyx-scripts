## Half-Life: Alyx Scripts

These are various scripts for use with Half-Life: Alyx. 

### Installation

1. Create the directory game/hlvr/scripts

2. Copy the folder vscripts into this new folder

3. Load up the game, and you're done!

### Installing user scripts

All scripts in the user/ directory are custom scripts by me. If you wish to install more user scripts do the following:

1. Copy the script to scripts/vscripts/user 

2. Add `include_script(user/myscript.lua)` to the end of `init.lua` in the `vscripts` directory

3. That's all!

### Running

Some of these script won't work unless you run the game under developer mode.

To do this, follow these instructions:

1. Right click on Half-Life Alyx in the steam library
2. Click Properties
3. Click "Set Launch Options"
4. Add `-dev` in that box
5. Click OK.
